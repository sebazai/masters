For the past decade, web accessibility legislation in the EU has enforced the public sector websites to comply with the web accessibility guidelines \citep{eudirective2016}. Additionally, the European Accessibility Act will enforce some of the private sector websites to comply as well at the end of June 2025 \citep{eudirective2019}. The purpose of the legislation is to provide equal access to digital information and services for people with disabilities.
