A review of previous research and our own comparative analysis revealed that the tools differ not only in functionality and result presentation, but also in violation discovery. Overviews of the Web Accessibility Directive Expert Group meetings` minutes and first reports by the European member states showed that unified monitoring and reporting do not exist between member states. We provided guidelines that would meet the minimum requirements of the Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/1524, as well as guidelines for more detailed evaluation, which would improve results in terms of providing a clearer picture of the actual level of accessibility and enable efficient comparison between European member states.},

abstract = {The use of web accessibility evaluation tools is a widespread practice. Evaluation tools are heavily employed as they help in reducing the burden of identifying accessibility barriers. However, an over-reliance on automated tests often leads to setting aside further testing that entails expert evaluation and user tests. In this paper we empirically show the capabilities of current automated evaluation tools. To do so, we investigate the effectiveness of 6 state-of-the-art tools by analysing their coverage, completeness and correctness with regard to WCAG 2.0 conformance. We corroborate that relying on automated tests alone has negative effects and can have undesirable consequences. Coverage is very narrow as, at most, 50\% of the success criteria are covered. Similarly, completeness ranges between 14\% and 38\%; however, some of the tools that exhibit higher completeness scores produce lower correctness scores (66-71\%) due to the fact that catching as many violations as possible can lead to an increase in false positives. Therefore, relying on just automated tests entails that 1 of 2 success criteria will not even be analysed and among those analysed, only 4 out of 10 will be caught at the further risk of generating false positives.},

We found that individual tools still provide limited coverage of the success criteria; the coverage of success criteria varies quite a lot from evaluation engine to evaluation engine; what are the most and least covered success criteria in automated evaluations. After analysing the results, we highly recommend to use more than one tool (with a different engine) and to complement automated evaluation with manual checking.},

To tackle those problems, the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) [1], since its creation in 1997, has worked on improving accessibility of the Web for people with disabilities by providing guidelines (WCAG) and tools for Web Accessibility Assessments. This study aims to compare free and open-source tools from the official (W3C) list of WAETs for evaluating websites against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 standards [2]; the comparison is based on the coverage error ratio (CER) metric that compares the performance of WAETs in identifying Web accessibility problems.},

abstract = {Accessibility auditors have to choose a method when evaluating accessibility: expert review (a.k.a. conformance testing), user testing, subjective evaluations, barrier walkthrough are some possibilities. However, little is known to date about their relative strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, what happened for usability evaluation methods is likely to repeat for accessibility: that there is uncertainty about not only pros and cons of methods, but also about criteria to be used to compare them and metrics to measure these criteria. After a quick review and description of methods, the paper illustrates a comparative test of two web accessibility evaluation methods: conformance testing and barrier walkthrough. The comparison aims at determining merits of barrier walkthrough, using conformance testing as a control condition. A comparison framework is outlined, followed by the description of a laboratory experiment with 12 subjects (novice accessibility evaluators), and its results. Significant differences were found in terms of correctness, one of the several metrics used to compare the methods. Reliability also appears to be different.},

Further, testability of WCAG 2.0 criteria is achieved if 80\% of knowledgeable inspectors agree that the criteria has been met or not. In this paper we investigate the very core WCAG 2.0, being their ability to determine web content accessibility conformance. We conducted an empirical study to ascertain the testability of WCAG 2.0 success criteria when experts and non-experts evaluated four relatively complex web pages; and the differences between the two. Further, we discuss the validity of the evaluations generated by these inspectors and look at the differences in validity due to expertise.In summary, our study, comprising 22 experts and 27 non-experts, shows that approximately 50\% of success criteria fail to meet the 80\% agreement threshold; experts produce 20\% false positives and miss 32\% of the true problems. We also compared the performance of experts against that of non-experts and found that agreement for the non-experts dropped by 6\%, false positives reach 42\% and false negatives 49\%. This suggests that in many cases WCAG 2.0 conformance cannot be tested by human inspection to a level where it is believed that at least 80\% of knowledgeable human evaluators would agree on the conclusion. Why experts fail to meet the 80\% threshold and what can be done to help achieve this level are the subjects of further investigation.},

 abstract = {Two paradigms characterize much of the research in the Information Systems discipline: behavioral science and design science. The behavioral-science paradigm seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of people, organizations, and technology. Our objective is to describe the performance of design-science research in Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework and clear guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the research. In the design-science paradigm, knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its solution are achieved in the building and application of the designed artifact. Three recent exemplars in the research literature are used to demonstrate the application of these guidelines. We conclude with an analysis of the challenges of performing high-quality design-science research in the context of the broader IS community.},

abstract = {The paper motivates, presents, demonstrates in use, and evaluates a methodology for conducting design science (DS) research in information systems (IS). DS is of importance in a discipline oriented to the creation of successful artifacts. Several researchers have pioneered DS research in IS, yet over the past 15 years, little DS research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for DS research and of a template for its presentation may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology (DSRM) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing DS research, and it provides a mental model for presenting and evaluating DS research in IS. The DS process includes six steps: problem identification and motivation, definition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms of the DSRM, including cases that present the design of a database to support health assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application, and an IS planning method. The designed methodology effectively satisfies the three objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of DS research in the IS discipline.},

One common issue in using accessibility evaluation tools in practice is that the results provided by different tools are often variable. Such variability may confuse the users who may not understand the reasons behind it, and thus limits the possible adoption of such tools. Hence, there is a need to shed light on the tools' actual functioning, indicate what criteria they should adopt to be transparent and to help users better interpret their results. In this communication paper, we discuss such issues, analyse how they have been addressed by a representative set of tools, and provide useful indications for obtaining user-centred accessibility evaluations.},
