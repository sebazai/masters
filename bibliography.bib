abstract = {Accessibility auditors have to choose a method when evaluating accessibility: expert review (a.k.a. conformance testing), user testing, subjective evaluations, barrier walkthrough are some possibilities. However, little is known to date about their relative strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, what happened for usability evaluation methods is likely to repeat for accessibility: that there is uncertainty about not only pros and cons of methods, but also about criteria to be used to compare them and metrics to measure these criteria. After a quick review and description of methods, the paper illustrates a comparative test of two web accessibility evaluation methods: conformance testing and barrier walkthrough. The comparison aims at determining merits of barrier walkthrough, using conformance testing as a control condition. A comparison framework is outlined, followed by the description of a laboratory experiment with 12 subjects (novice accessibility evaluators), and its results. Significant differences were found in terms of correctness, one of the several metrics used to compare the methods. Reliability also appears to be different.},

abstract={This paper claims that effectiveness of automatic tools for evaluating web site accessibility has to be itself evaluated, given the increasingly important role that these tools play. The paper presents a comparison method for a pair of tools that takes into account correctness, completeness and specificity in supporting the task of assessing the conformance of a web site with respect to established guidelines. The paper presents data acquired during a case study based on comparing LIFT Machine with Bobby. The data acquired from the case study is used to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the comparison method. The conclusion is that even though there is room for improvement of the method, it is already capable of providing accurate and reliable conclusions.},

abstract = {Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0) require that success criteria be tested by human inspection. Further, testability of WCAG 2.0 criteria is achieved if 80\% of knowledgeable inspectors agree that the criteria has been met or not. In this paper we investigate the very core WCAG 2.0, being their ability to determine web content accessibility conformance. We conducted an empirical study to ascertain the testability of WCAG 2.0 success criteria when experts and non-experts evaluated four relatively complex web pages; and the differences between the two. Further, we discuss the validity of the evaluations generated by these inspectors and look at the differences in validity due to expertise.In summary, our study, comprising 22 experts and 27 non-experts, shows that approximately 50\% of success criteria fail to meet the 80\% agreement threshold; experts produce 20\% false positives and miss 32\% of the true problems. We also compared the performance of experts against that of non-experts and found that agreement for the non-experts dropped by 6\%, false positives reach 42\% and false negatives 49\%. This suggests that in many cases WCAG 2.0 conformance cannot be tested by human inspection to a level where it is believed that at least 80\% of knowledgeable human evaluators would agree on the conclusion. Why experts fail to meet the 80\% threshold and what can be done to help achieve this level are the subjects of further investigation.},
