% Generate title page.
\maketitle

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% STEP 3:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Write your abstract in the separate file, to be positioned here.
%% You can make several abstract pages (if you want it in different languages),
%% in which case you should also define the language of the abstract,
%% as below.

\include{Ch.00_Abstract}

% Place ToC
%\newpage
\mytableofcontents

\mainmatter

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% STEP 4: Write the thesis.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Your actual text starts here. You shouldn't mess with the code above the line except
%% to change the parameters. Removing the abstract and ToC commands will mess up stuff.
%%
%% Command \include{file} includes the file of name file.tex.
%% A new page will be created at every \include command, 
%% which makes it appropriate to use it for large entities such as book chapters. Cannot be nested.
%% It is useful for a big project, as changing one of the include targets 
%% won't force the regeneration of the outputs of all the rest.
%% Alternatively, \input is a more lower level macro 
%% which simply inputs the content of the given file like it was copy&pasted there manually.
