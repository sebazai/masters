\chapter{Background\label{background}}

Web accessibility aims to ensure an equitable online experience for users of diverse abilities. According to World Health Organization, an estimate of over 1.3 billion people worldwide face some form of disability \citep{whodisability}. The significance of web accessibility is increasingly apparent. This chapter delve into web accessibility. In section 2.1 we describe what is web accessibility in detail, what is the current situation in form of legislation and guidelines. Section 2.2 defines the affect of web accessibility on a web developer's work. Section 2.3 is about the test automation tools.

\section{Accessibility}

Web accessibility is defined that each person has an equal opportunity to interact with web services on any device regardless their disabilities \citep{webaccessibilitydefinition}. Web designers, developers and content creators implement web accessibility. Accessibility is built upon these three topics, technical implementation, ease of use and comprehensibility of content. Technical implementation provides functionality for assistive technologies in the web source code. Ease of use involves having a user experience with clearly structured frame for navigation and content placement. Comprehensibility of content is the structure of the content itself. 

The technical implementation is mainly done by web developers, ease of use is a web designers responsibility and the content itself is written and structured by content creators.
