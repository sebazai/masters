\chapter{Background\label{background}}

Web accessibility aims to ensure an equitable online experience for users of diverse abilities. According to World Health Organization, an estimate of over 1.3 billion people worldwide face some form of disability \citep{whodisability}. The significance of web accessibility is increasingly apparent. This chapter delve into web accessibility. In section 2.1 we describe what is web accessibility in detail, what is the current situation in form of legislation and guidelines. Section 2.2 defines the affect of web accessibility on a web developer's work. Section 2.3 is about the test automation tools.

\section{Accessibility}

Web accessibility is defined that each person has an equal opportunity to interact with web services on any device regardless their disabilities \citep{webaccessibilitydefinition}. Web designers, developers and content creators implement web accessibility. Accessibility is built upon these three topics, technical implementation, ease of use and comprehensibility of content. Technical implementation provides functionality for assistive technologies in the web source code based on web standards. Ease of use involves having a user experience with clearly structured frame for navigation and content placement. Comprehensibility of content is the structure of the content itself, that is the content is written in short paragraph and plain language. 

%% In web development the technical implementation is mainly done by web developers, ease of use is web designers responsibility and page content itself is written and structured by content creators. However, there might be overlap in responsibilities 


\subsection{Legislation}

The emergence of directives and legislative measures plays a role in the goal to develop best practices for web accessibility \citep{eudirective2016}. The European Union (EU) Directive 2016/2102 was adopted in 2016 to ratify part of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by the United Nations. The Directive enforces EU Member States to ensure that their public sector implements and monitors accessibility on their web pages and applications. The Directive refers to the European Standard EN 301 549 that specifies the accessibility requirements for ICT products and services. In the first version of the Standard the guidelines and requirements were based based on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 provided by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) \citep{wcagadoptioneurope}. Since 2018 the Standard has a direct reference to the WCAG version 2.1.

- Why is this topic important? EU Directive, legislation on public/private sector, European Accessibility Act incoming -> With thread to WCAG

- Monitoring with automated testing tools; https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32018D1524

\subsection{Guidelines}

- Latest guidelines, WCAG 2.2. Write about the 4 principles; perceivable, operable, understandable and robust. Create a table to describe these 4 principles, the success criteria, the classification required by law (A, AA, AAA).

\section{Accessibility in web programming}

- Talk about what the guidelines means for a web developer perspective; use WCAG 2.2 "How to meet WCAG compliance" as reference

- Dive into some of the most basic accessibility, what it means
\section{Accessibility evaluation}

- Write about how accessibility can be tested. Automated/manual requirements.
